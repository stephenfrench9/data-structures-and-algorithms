    //
    // And of course, as always, you may also use any of the data structures
    // and algorithms we've implemented so far.
    //
    // Note: If you plan on adding a new class, please be sure to make it a private
    // static inner class contained within this file. Our testing infrastructure
    // works by copying specific files from your project to ours, and if you
    // add new files, they won't be copied and your code will not compile.

    //
    // NOTE 2:
    //
    // You may notice that the generic types of Graph are a little bit more
    // complicated then usual.
    //
    // This class uses two generic parameters: V and E.
    //
    // - 'V' is the type of the vertices in the graph. The vertices can be
    //   any type the client wants -- there are no restrictions.
    //
    // - 'E' is the type of the edges in the graph. We've contrained Graph
    //   so that E *must* always be an instance of Edge<V> AND Comparable<E>.
    //
    //   What this means is that if you have an object of type E, you can use
    //   any of the methods from both the Edge interface and from the Comparable
    //   interface
    //
    // If you have any additional questions about generics, or run into issues while
    // working with them, please ask ASAP either on Piazza or during office hours.
    //
    // Working with generics is really not the focus of this class, so if you
    // get stuck, let us know we'll try and help you get unstuck as best as we can.
