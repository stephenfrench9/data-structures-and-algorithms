This repo is an exercise in Data Structures and Algorithms, following Weiss 3rd edition and CSE 373 at the University of Washington. I implement data structures from scratch and use them in various applications to demonstrate basic principles of algorithm design. 

## basic-data-structures/ 
This folder contains an implementation of a double linked list and an array dictionary.

## symbolic-calculator/ 
I use the above data structures and an abstract syntax tree to build a calculator cabable of symbolic operations, in the style of Mathematics.

## hashing/
I implement a chained hash set and a chained hash dictionary

## search-engine/
Still in progress, I use the above data structures to build a mock webpage search

## mazes/
I present and solve a basic problem in graph theory. Kruskal's algorithm in combination with Djikstra's are used to solve a maze.
